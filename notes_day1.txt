1. discover/extract information about a type during runtime: Runtime Type Discovery
Type typeOfCalculation = calc.GetType();
or
Type typeOfCalculation = typeof(Calculation);

2. Extracting piece of information from a type information, such as, field or method or property etc. information

MethodInfo multiplyMethodInfo = typeOfCalculation.GetMethod("Multiply");

3. Creating object of a type based on metadata of that type during runtime: Dynamic object creation
 object objOfCalculation = Activator.CreateInstance(typeOfCalculation);

4. invoking a member (method/property) based on metadata of that member: dynamic invocation
 object result = multiplyMethodInfo.Invoke( objOfCalculation,
                 			new object[] { 12, 13 });
Console.WriteLine(result);
